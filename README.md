# Central African Republic Exports Time Series Analysis

This project examines the time series data of Central African Republic (CAR) exports, crucial for its economy heavily reliant on agriculture and various goods. Political instability and subsequent pandemics present challenges to accurate predictions, highlighting the need for nuanced approaches in modeling and forecasting. While an ARMA(2,2) model provides insights into past export trends, uncertainties remain due to complex relationships and external factors. This underscores the importance of considering historical context and refining forecasting models to better understand CAR's export dynamics.
